    #### Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5MzLtdSUUM
    #### Description:
        This python project can be used to convert an plain text message like "hello world" to an morse code as well as can be used to convert an morsecoded message into a simple text message.
        The program first asks the user to select the functionality the user is interested in (ie. encryption of the essage or decryption of the message).
        After selection, the user has to input the message he wants to convert.
        If the user has selected encryption then he has to input a simple regular text message and program converts it into a morse code.
        And similar for the decryption.


    ** Input the message in all capitalized while encrypting**
